Welcome to my personal blog! You may notice that **the blog is driven by Wiki.js**, a Node.js based wiki engine. I made this decision for three reasons. Firstly, I enjoy trying new things, the deployment of Wiki.js gave me a chance to try Node.js, PostgreSQL and Docker. Secondly, in my points of view, timeline of my posts are not so important and one should visit a blog with a purpose other than "checking if any new posts are created". Finally, wikis can better manage fragmented contents.

**Unfortunately**, most of my posts are only available in Chinese, and you have to change your preferred language to Chinese and use a translator to view those posts. Sorry for your inconvenience.

A brief self introduction here. I am **Jialin Rong** (bobby285271). Currently I am learning software engineering in South China Normal University. Feel free to follow my GitHub / Codeforces account.
